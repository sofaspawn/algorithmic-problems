# finding the friend

### problem statement:

> Suppose you are standing exactly at a crossing point of two roads namely North-South road and East-
> West road (as shown in the figure) in your city. And your friend F is visiting your city for the first time and
> he/she is waiting for you to pick up. F is standing near to the same crossing point but not exactly at the crossing
> point. Assume F is standing at distance d from the crossing point but F is not able to inform you the direction
> and distance from the crossing point.
> You are supposed to walk from the crossing point to your
> friend and pick him/her up. You can see your friend if you are in
> the right direction and at the right distance from the crossing
> point otherwise you cannot see your friend. As you donâ€™t know
> the distance and direction in which your friend is standing, you
> may need to design a strategy to search for your friend such that
> you need to walk minimum distance.

### my solutions:
strat.py -> obvious but really bad solution
strat2.py -> a bit more intuitive, still not the best
